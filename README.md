This project is an example to how can we implement an MVC project in Unity.
This project follows two main design choice:
- The projects only uses tools provided by Unity out of the box, so it doesn't use any additional Plugins / Nugets/ dlls
- The only classes that inherit from MonoBehaviour are the View Classes, and in rare cases some logical component needed to create some design patterns in a clean way
